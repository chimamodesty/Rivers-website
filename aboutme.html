      <p>My name is Chima Modesty Chinedum. I am studying Applied Technology in Brigham Young university,Idaho. I love dancing and jogging. I also love to play Table Tennis. I am married and we have two kids(Michelle and Nelson). I love BYU-Idaho because of the opportunity they offered me to obtain 3 certificates in addition to my degree. I am pursuing a Bs.c degree in Applied Technology. I am taking web design course because I love technology courses and want to be a professional web developer.I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since 2002. I love the church because of their believe in education and continouos learning. President James E.Faust said, "Learning and education have always been the hallmark of our people."</p>
